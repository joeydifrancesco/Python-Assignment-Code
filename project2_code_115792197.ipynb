in his tracks and he said, \"Hey goat\\nWould you like to live with me?\\nI\\'ve got a house with a pick-up truck\\nIn a place across the sea\"\\nI said, \"Sure, why not, I\\'ve got no family\\nYou seem like a nice guy\"\\nSo we went off to America\\nThe home of the apple pie\\nOn the boat, the old man told me\\nI would be a present for his wife\\nA talking goat, he exclaimed\\nShe\\'d never seen this in her life, I felt so special\\nWell, I just couldn\\'t believe it\\nAfter all these years I finally had a friend\\nHe trimmed my beard, he scraped my hooves\\nI prayed it would never end\\nBut when we got to his house, there was no wife\\nOnly a short, short letter\\nIt said, \"I\\'m leaving you for your brother\\nBecause he fucks me better\"\\nHis eyes filled with tears of sadness\\nHis heart was filled with grief\\nTo soothe himself he drank a pint of Old Granddad\\nAnd beat me like a side of beef\\nI screamed, \"Send me back to the hills of Europe\"\\nHe just shook his head and said, \"Nope\"\\nNo one will ever leave me again\\nTo make sure, put on this 3-foot fucking rope\\nPresent day, I\\'ve been on the truck for 51 years\\nMy only friend is the am radio\\nSometimes the neighborhood children stop by\\nBut it\\'s always rocks and beer bottles they throw\\nAt first they\\'re excited to see a talking goat\\nThey gather around to hear what I have to say\\nBut I guess sometimes my stories go on too long\\nSo they leave and giggle I need a bidet\\nBut you know there was a night that I did get off the truck\\nWhen the old man was passed out drunk\\nThree neighborhood kids took me to a rock \\'n\\' roll concert\\nThe kind of music, old-school funk\\nIt was the first time I got off the truck the music made me lose control\\nThe lead singer asked if we were having fun\\nI said, \"Fucking crank that rock \\'n\\' roll\"\\nThe women at the show were beautiful\\nAs they danced sexily on the soft grass\\nOne of them even petted my fur, fuck me in the goat-ass\\nThen some long-haired guys grabbed me by the horns\\nAnd threw me in the mosh pit\\nThey passed me around and treated me nice\\nTill I nervously sprayed them with shit\\nThen the music stopped and everything was quite\\nAnd all the rock \\'n\\' rollers started a fucking goat-riot\\nKill the goat, kill the goat\\nKill the goat, kill the goat\\nThey chased me under the bleachers\\nThey chased me onto the street\\nThey chased me into an alley\\nAnd said, \"I was a dead fucking goat meat\"\\nBut then I saw a sight that I never thought I\\'d see\\nThe old man swinging his hickory stick\\nBut he wasn\\'t swinging at me\\n\"Fuck you, pot-smoking turkeys don\\'t you press your luck\"\\nThe long hairs ran away screaming as I scrambled onto the truck\\nWhen we got home, the old man said, \"Goat, you broke the sacred law\"\\nNo, please, sorry, shit\\nI\\'ll let it go this time, but if you leave again I\\'ll break your fucking jaw\\nSuper, great, okay\\nThank you old man, for saving my life\\nThank you again and again\\nYou could have let them barbecue me\\nBut you acted like a friend\\n\"I\\'m not your friend, I don\\'t even like you I\\'m just not drunk,\" he said\\nTo prove his point, he drank a bottle of grain alcohol\\nAnd beat the fucking shit out of my head\\nOw, ow, you\\'re hurting me old man\\nThat night I served a concussion\\nDeep inside my goat brain\\nI still cannot feel my tail bone\\nAnd I\\'ll probably never walk straight again, yeah\\nI guess you\\'d call me a scapegoat\\nA punching bag for the old man to mock\\nJust because his wife

the fate of my learned friend and colleague\\nDoctor Ignatius Stone. That brilliant researcher was last seen in command\\nof all his faculties whilst on an expedition to the ruins of the Sumerian\\ncity of Ur, an undertaking which preceded my own work there by some eighteen\\nmonths. Stone was a gifted archaeologist who also dabbled, perhaps unwisely,\\nin certain areas of the occult, particularly involving the various\\ngrotesqueries once worshipped as Cthonic deities by the ancient denizens of Ur.\\nMere days before he ventured into the ziggurats of that foreboding,\\nmystery-haunted site, he had dispatched a letter to me claiming that he was\\non the verge of a truly staggering arcane discovery at Ur which would\\nsimultaneously prove the cyclical nature of human civilisation as well as\\nimmediately render redundant all previous theories on the origin of man.\\nWhatever misfortune befell him within those aeons-old tombs robbed him\\nirrevocably of his sanity, for when his attendants finally managed to prise\\nopen the stone door of the vast central catacomb, which had, I'm told,\\ninexplicably shut fast behind his three-man torch-bearing party, they found\\ntwo of the regularly stalwart men had seemingly expired of pure fright,\\nwhile Stone was slumped against the north wall, staring vacantly into the\\ngloom, gibbering about visitations by beings so terrible that the very\\ncontemplation of their existence would sunder a man's tenuous hold on the\\nreins of sanity.\\nWhen I later visited him at the sanatorium in England, I found him to be a\\ntragic shell of the man I once knew, a man beset by imagined terrors and\\never wary of the immemorial horrors which he claimed lurked at the periphery\\nof humanity's perceptions. Indeed, I was glad I had taken a journal into\\nwhich I could transcribe his delusional rants, for he had a great deal to\\ntell me about The Dreamer In The Catacombs Of Ur:\", 'Every night I tell myself,\\n\"I am the cosmos,\\nI am the wind\"\\nBut that don\\'t get you back again\\nJust when I was starting to feel okay\\nYou\\'re on the phone\\nI never wanna be alone\\nNever wanna be alone\\nI hate to have to take you home\\nWanted too much to say no, no,\\nYeah, yeah, yeah\\nYeah, yeah, yeah\\nNever wanna be alone\\nI hate to have to take you home\\nWant you too much to say no, no\\nYeah, yeah, yeah\\nYeah, yeah, yeah\\nMy feeling\\'s always happening\\nSomething I couldn\\'t hide\\nI can\\'t confide\\nDon\\'t know what\\'s going on inside\\nSo every night I tell myself\\n\"I am the cosmos,\\nI am the wind\"\\nBut that don\\'t get you back again\\nI\\'d really like to see you again\\nI really wanna see you again\\nI\\'d really like to see you again\\nI really wanna see you again\\nI\\'d really like to see you again\\nI really wanna see you again\\nI never wanna see you again\\nReally wanna see you again', \"Girl you know we belong together\\nI don't have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this\\nYou'll be mine forever baby, you just see\\nWe belong together\\nAnd you know that I'm right\\nWhy do you play with my heart\\nWhy do you play with my mind\\nSaid we'd be forever\\nSaid it'd never die\\nHow could you love me and leave me and never\\nSay good-bye\\nWhen I can't sleep at night without holding you tight\\nGirl, each time I try I just break down and cry\\nPain in my head oh I'd rather be dead\\nSpinnin' around and around\\nAlthough we've come to the end of the road\\nStill I can't let go\\nIt's unnatural\\nYou belong to me\\nI belong to you\\nCome to the end of the road\\nStill I can't let go\\nIt's unnatural\\nYou belong to me\\nI belong to you\\n[Chorus]\\nGirl, I know you really love me\\nYou just don't realize\\nYou've never been there before\\nIt's only your first time\\nMaybe I'll forgive you\\nMaybe you'll try\\nWe should be happy together forever\\nYou and I\\nCan you love me again like you loved me before\\nThis time I want you to love me much more\\nThis time instead just come to my bed\\nAnd baby just don't let me down\\nGirl I'm here for you\\nAll those times of night when you just hurt me\\nAnd just ran out with that other fella\\nBaby I knew about it, I just didn't care\\nYou just don't understand how much I love you do you?\\nI'm here for you\\nI'm not out to go out and cheat on you all night\\nJust like you did baby but that's all right\\nHey, I love you anyway\\nAnd I'm still gonna be here for you 'till my dying day baby\\nRight now, I'm just in so much pain baby\\nCause you just won't come back to me\\nWill you?

niggas\\nStrikin down Broadway\\nI caught some niggas out of bounds from the (pause) upper MLK\\nSlowly crept from the cut at a quick pace\\nAin't no love in my heart all I feel is hate\\nSo 25 with

fuckin moon I watch the neighbors closing curtains turning\\nOut the porch lights and I dont even know why\\nOn a stroll all alony like nobodies gonna die\\nIm just looking for the answers to the questions that im asking\\nMore lost then when I started darted\\nThis means that time is passing barely grasping\\nTo the moment and irrational thoughts\\nAnd this prescription in my pocket got me feeling distraught\\nIts just a matter of time I feel my brain is growing vacant\\nWhat the fuck is going on Im like an old timers patient\\nAnd this situation it seems like dj vu\\nI wish I had an explanation and I pray I knew\\nHow I got to where Im going what Im trying to find\\nLooking for my sanity but I lost my fuckin mind\\nNo where to be found I think I need some fuckin help\\nWalking after midnight and Im searching for myself\\n[Chorus:]\\nIm fucking walking (fucking walking)\\nOut in the moonlight (through the darkness)\\nAfter midnight (hay)\\nSearching for you (Im trying to find you)\\n[Violent J:]\\nRight foot over left\\nLeft foot over right\\nI let my dog out to piss in the middle of the night\\nIn my backyard illuminated by the moonlight\\nWas a women in the haze and from the back shes looking tight\\nWorry not he dont bite but why are you in my yard miss\\nShe waved me on to fallow and then ran into the darkness\\nAll I had on were slippers still a gave a chase\\nFallowing an angle and I have yet to see her face\\nWith ease she passes through trees her gown blows in the breeze\\nIm slapping though puddles and scratching up my knees\\nPlease tell me your name and where the hell where headed\\nTo the cemetery where the answers are imbedded on her tombstone\\nShes home\\nShe stopped running\\nI finally caught up and was about to ask something\\nWhen she turned around a demon\\nA snake for a tongue\\nAnd it bite me food for the dead Ive become\\n[Chorus 2x:]\\nIm fucking walking (fucking walking)\\nOut in the moonlight (through the darkness)\\nAfter midnight (hay)\\nSearching for you (Im trying to find you)\\n[Shaggy 2 Dope:]\\nWhats ding-a-linging nothing in my drawer\\nChasing after that dragon but not the hara boy\\nIts big and shinny and dripping with blood\\nWhyd I do\\nBecause I said that I could\\nNow my only problem Im looking for that tool\\nWhen I hit him with it all I seen was dripping n drool\\nBut I put it somewhere\\nWhere\\nWe can all guess\\nThe simple fact is I blacked out and slit her neck\\nBack to the problem at hand\\nMemories of motherfucker wit him looking for that murder weapon\\nIf I had recollection I wouldnt have to sweat police\\nNow my drawers are open sweating trying to find this piece\\nI cant miss it if I see it wooden handle shinny edge\\nshredding it every angle as if I jump off a league\\nPicking through the leaves digging through the dirt\\nHiding every breath Im talking Im gonna make this shit work\\n[Chorus 2x:]\\nIm fucking walking (fucking walking)\\nOut in the
